## Hello👿, Human  
We are the Evil Cat Team (👿🐱🐱) – here to stir up some playful trouble (and maybe fix a bug or two when no one's looking)!  

## 🔮 About US  
- **Team Members**:  
  👿🐱 [Kafuu Neko](https://github.com/KafuuNeko) | 🐶 [hhyufan](https://github.com/hhyufan) | 🦊 [YukiIsait](https://github.com/YukiIsait) | 🐟️ [yuyuaqwq](https://github.com/yuyuaqwq) | 🍰 [Shiratamakeki](https://github.com/JadeCake5) *& other mysterious creatures*  

- **Evil Mission**:  
  To conquer the open-source world—one purr-fectly crafted project at a time! We specialize in coding, chaos, and occasionally napping on keyboards.  

- **Secret Weapons**:  
  🐾 **Paw-some Collaboration**: We stack code like cats stack on keyboards—efficiently and with minimal regard for personal space.  
  🔥 **Bug Extermination**: We hunt bugs as if they’re laser pointers—relentlessly and with extreme prejudice.  
  🎉 **Community Shenanigans**: We believe open-source should be fun, furry, and occasionally filled with mischief.  

- **Disclaimer**:  
  No keyboards were harmed in the making of our projects (except for the one covered in cat hair).
